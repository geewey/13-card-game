### Basics of "Thirteen" card game:

- "Thirteen" is a climbing game, where the goal is to be the first player to finish playing all your cards.
- There are 4 players. The player who goes first is the one dealt the 3 of spades - and must play it in their first combo.
- The following players must either play a "bigger" combo of same type.
- If a player is unable or unwilling to play, they can "pass." This means they are out of the current round and cannot play until a new round begins.
- At the beginning of each new round, the first player to go is whomever won the last round. They can play whatever combo they want.

### What combos can be played:

- There are basically 2 types of combos:
  (1) single/double/triple/or quad of the same card (ex: 10, 4-4, 7-7-7, Q-Q-Q-Q), or
  (2) straights of 3+ consecutive singles/doubles/triples (also known as a run, ex: 3-4-5, 5-6-7-8-9-10, J-J-Q-Q-K-K).
- A straight must be consecutive and cannot contain any 2s.
- The longest possible straight goes from 3 through A.

### Card order:

- By rank: 3s are the smallest, and 2s are the largest. (reminder: 2s cannot be used in straights)
- By suit, smallest to largest: spade, club, diamond, hearts
- Thus, 2 of hearts is largest and 3 of spades is smallest
- The largest card in the combo is what determines what to beat (ex: 4-5-6-7 of clubs can be beaten by 4-5-6-7 of hearts)
- Thus, the largest possible straight has the Ace of Hearts at the top of the straight
